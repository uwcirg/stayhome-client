# StayHome
The COVID-19 pandemic is straining existing public health processes and workflows. Many community members may be concerned about developing COVID-19. To support community members, we have developed StayHome.

StayHome (https://stayhome.app) is a mobile-friendly web app that supports people who want to track COVID-19 symptoms; link to CDCâ€™s Self-Checker decision support; record at-risk conditions, exposures/contacts/travel or COVID-19 testing/results; and find sources for information. StayHome lets users choose to share identified or anonymous information with public health agencies. The project is described at: https://project.stayhome.app, and the button on that page links to the app, which does not require installation. You do not need an account to access information about COVID-19, and you can create an account to start self-tracking. The app is available for public use. Feel free to share the links.

Developed by the Clinical Informatics Research Group (CIRG) at University of Washington, 2019-2020. Read more about us here: [https://www.cirg.washington.edu/](https://www.cirg.washington.edu/)

# Development
## Troubleshooting
CouchbaseLite-Swift should be at least version 2.5.3, otherwise we might run into issues with swift version mismatches (at least with Xcode >=11).
Change this in fluttercouch.podspec (either .pubcache/host/... or in checkout directory if checking out fluttercouch from github separately).
Run `pod update CouchbaseLite-Swift`, then `pod install`

"The application's Info.plist does not contain CFBundleVersion."

The Xcode project should have CFBundleVersion ("Bundle version") under Runner target
(not project) -> Info -> Custom iOS Target Properties. It might be something like $(FLUTTER_BUILD_NAME)
 which will be null if this environment variable can't be resolved. For a quick fix, just change this
 to a hard coded number.

"Cocoa pods did not set the configuration because there is already a custom configuration... In order for
CocoaPods to work at all ..."

In Xcode click on the project -> Project (not target) -> Info tab -> Configurations -> change the
drop down for each of "Profile", "Release", and "Debug" to "None", then run `pod install`

"error: module compiled with Swift 5.0 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.1 compiler: "
 ... /mapapp/map-app-client/ios/Pods/CouchbaseLite-Swift/iOS/CouchbaseLiteSwift.framework/Modules/CouchbaseLiteSwift.swiftmodule/x86_64.swiftmodule
  import CouchbaseLiteSwift"

This is an issue with the Couchbase version dependency. Make sure you depend on a recent version of CouchbaseSwift (one that was compiled with swift 5.1 or newer).
One solution is to checkout fluttercouch and build from source, making sure to update the CouchbaseLite version in the podspec:

 pubspec.yaml:
 ```
 fluttercouch:
  path: ../fluttercouch/
 ```

 update version dependency:
 ```
 sed -i 's/~> 2.5.1/~> 2.6.3/g' ../fluttercouch/ios/fluttercouch.podspec
 ```
 
 On iOS, if you start getting "no user" errors on hot reload or hot restart, try restarting the simulator.
