To meet this need we have developed StayHome, an app to help people who are staying home to minimize any risk they might present to others do things like track their symptoms and temperature, connect with relevant information and resources, and maintain a diary of people with whom they have had contact. We hope the app might also help people and public health connect more easily, when needed, in a situation where public health resources may be stretched thin.",

Or, who simply want to know how best to \"stay home\". Faculty, students, and staff at CIRG are doing this work to help people in our university, local, regional, state, national, and global communities.\n\nThe University of Washington (UW) is not responsible or liable for the accuracy or security of the information in the app. The UW did not develop the system, does not operate it, and has not endorsed it.\n\nThe privacy of your information is important to us. We do our best to keep our clinical information systems private and secure, but we are offering this application without any assurance or warranty.\n\nWe do not track GPS location information from your phone. We do not link your IP address to your information. We do use standard web analytic software (Matomo) to understand user patterns and will look at access logs if we suspect an attempt to compromise the security of our systems.\n\nYou can use this app without entering any personal information by skipping the prompts that ask for it. The system will be less able to personalize to your needs, but that's OK with us. We want you to use this app however you feel most comfortable doing so.\n\nThe Resources section of the app is available to anyone. You are welcome to use that feature without creating an account or logging in.\n\nIf you choose to create an account you will need to give us an email address, but you are welcome to use a fake email address. If your email is fake, you will not be able to recover your password, but everything else in the app will work the same. You can update your email address later, but you can't change your username.\n\nPlease look carefully at the Profile page. We explain on that page the uses of your personal information, such as an email address, a cell phone number, a zip code/postal code, etc. We ask that you either use accurate information in the profile, so we can personalize the app for you, or that you leave these fields blank.",
