But, that information (level of illness, location) may be useful for public health planning even if you can not be contacted.  \n\nIf we have your location we can also personalize the information we give you about COVID-19 resources.",

Similarly, if you provide information about who you are, we’d appreciate it if you’d include sex and date of birth as those are standard ways of ensuring someone’s medical information gets attached to the correct clinic, testing, or hospital records.\n\nIf you don’t provide contact, location, or identifying information, we’d like you to provide us with your sex and as much of your date of birth as you’re willing to share.  Patterns of illness by age, sex, and location can be critical in helping public health shape an effective response.",
