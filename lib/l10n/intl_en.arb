We’re more interested in having you able to use the system than in having you worry about us collecting information, or keeping it safe. That said, each item on this page has a use, and you can always come back and update it later.",

You can provide a real location, even if you register with a fake email address and provide no other information. But that information (level of illness, location) may be useful for public health planning even if you can not be contacted.\n\nIf you enter your location, we can also personalize the information we give you about COVID-19 resources.",
  "profile_contact_info_help_text" : "If you provide your email, phone, or both, then we can make that info available to the public health agency responsible for your area, and we or they can contact you if needed. You will only be contacted if there is a specific reason to do so, one that we or the public health agency(s) believe to be in your best interest.\n\nIf you chose to set up your account with a fake email, you may provide us with a real one here, so we may contact you. But, doing so will not change your username. Likewise, if you used one email as a username when setting up your account, but would prefer a different email as your contact email, you can enter it here, but it will not change your username.",

We’d also appreciate it if you'd include sex and date of birth as those are standard ways of ensuring that the right person's medication information gets attached to the correct clinic, testing, or hospital records.\n\nIf you **have not provided** location or contact information, it would still be helpful if you could let us know your sex, the year, and perhaps the month of your birth (you can enter a fake day, or month, if you want). Patterns of illness by age, sex, and location can be critical in helping public health shape an effective response.",

  "terms_of_use": "This app was built by the Clinical Informatics Research Group (CIRG), at the University of Washington, in order to benefit people, like you, who may be concerned about infection with Coronavirus (COVID-19). Or, who simply want to know how best to \"stay home\". Faculty, students, and staff at CIRG are doing this work to help people in our university, local, regional, state, national, and global communities.\n\nThe University of Washington (UW) is not responsible or liable for the accuracy or security of the information in the app. The UW did not develop the system, does not operate it, and has not endorsed it.\n\nThe privacy of your information is important to us. We do our best to keep our clinical information systems private and secure, but we are offering this application without any assurance or warranty.\n\nWe do not track GPS location information from your phone. We do not link your IP address to your information. We do use standard web analytic software (Matomo) to understand user patterns and will look at access logs if we suspect an attempt to compromise the security of our systems.\n\nYou can use this app without entering any personal information by skipping the prompts that ask for it. The system will be less able to personalize to your needs, but that's OK with us. We want you to use this app however you feel most comfortable doing so.\n\nThe Resources section of the app is available to anyone. You are welcome to use that feature without creating an account or logging in.\n\nIf you choose to create an account you will need to give us an email address, but you are welcome to use a fake email address. If your email is fake, you will not be able to recover your password, but everything else in the app will work the same. You can update your email address later, but you can't change your username.\n\nPlease look carefully at the Profile page. We explain on that page the uses of your personal information, such as an email address, a cell phone number, a zip code/postal code, etc. We ask that you either use accurate information in the profile, so we can personalize the app for you, or that you leave these fields blank.",
